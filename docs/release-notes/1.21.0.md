## Fixed Bugs

- We've fixed a bug where the `proxy-protocol` EnvoyFilter applied by the Istio module on AWS clusters with ELB load balancers was incorrectly detected as a user resource. This resulted in the Istio custom resource being set to the `Warning` state. See [#1491](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/issues/1491).
