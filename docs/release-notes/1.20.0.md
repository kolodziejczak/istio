## New Features

- The Istio module now supports the use of Istio sidecars as Kubernetes init containers. In addition to the default Istio containers, the module now also restarts native sidecar init containers. However, configuring native sidecars directly from the Istio Custom Resource (CR) is not supported. For more information, see [issue #1426](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/issues/1426).
